# Data-and-code-masters

This repository is to back up all my matlab code, for my analysis pipeline
This will only be for code, not data (despite name).  I hope to simplify the large number of individual analysis
scripts i've written into a small number of rigorous scripts that will take in any numbe of files, save data from 
them, do the required analysis and spit out results with attached info on sample number, sample conditions, etc.
